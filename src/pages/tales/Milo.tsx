          Milo was a boy who loved to dream. Not just the kind of dreams you have when you're asleep, but the big, bright, colorful dreams you carry in your heart all day long. He dreamed of flying, of talking to animals, and most of all, of a garden where everything was magical.
        </p>
        <p>
          One night, as Milo drifted off to sleep, he found himself in the most extraordinary garden he had ever seen. The grass was made of soft, glowing moss, and the trees had leaves that shimmered in every color of the rainbow. Flowers bloomed in impossible shapes, some like tiny bells that chimed with laughter, others like soft clouds that smelled of warm cookies.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Welcome, Milo," a gentle voice whispered. Milo looked around and saw a tiny, shimmering hummingbird with wings like stained glass. "This is the Dream Garden," it chirped. "It grows only for those who dream with all their heart."
        </p>
        <p>
          Milo spent his dream-night exploring. He tasted berries that sparkled like jewels and made him feel light as a feather. He listened to the stories told by the ancient, gnarled trees, whose branches reached up to touch the dream-stars. He played hide-and-seek with mischievous fireflies that giggled as they zipped through the air.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hummingbird explained that the Dream Garden was a special place where all the good thoughts and happy wishes from children's hearts came to grow. "The more you dream, the brighter it shines," it said, fluttering around a magnificent flower that pulsed with Milo's favorite color, a deep, calming blue.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the dream-night began to fade, Milo felt a pang of sadness. He didn't want to leave. "Will I ever see it again?" he asked the hummingbird.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Always," the hummingbird replied, its voice like tiny bells. "As long as you keep dreaming, the garden will be here, waiting for you. And a little piece of it will always stay in your heart, even when you're awake."
        </p>
        <p>
          Milo woke up with a smile on his face, the scent of warm cookies still lingering faintly in his room. He knew the Dream Garden was real, not just a dream. And from that day on, Milo dreamed bigger and brighter than ever before, knowing that with every happy thought, his magical garden grew a little more beautiful.
