          <p className="mb-4">Every parent dreams of the moment when bedtime feels peaceful. When tiny eyelids grow heavy, the home softens into quiet, and everyone finally exhales. If that still feels far away, you're not alone. Most families find bedtime to be the hardest hour of the day.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">The good news? Peaceful nights are not a mystery. They're the result of rhythm, safety, and connection. These are three ingredients that this guide will help you master.</p>

            <li>Behavior settles, moods lift, patience grows.</li>
            <li>Your toddler's brain consolidates memories and learns.</li>
            <li>Your body recoversâ€”immune function, hormones, mental clarity return.</li>

          </ul>
          
          <p className="mb-4">This isn't about rigid schedules. It's about predictable patterns that allow everyone to rest. Predictability is the opposite of control. It gives your child freedom to relax because they already know what's next.</p>
          
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-sidebar-primary-foreground">WHY GENTLE WORKS</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">Children fall asleep when their nervous systems feel safe. Science confirms that the bedtime struggle isn't about "stubbornness"; it's about overstimulation. Gentle, connection-based approaches regulate the nervous system first, so cooperation follows naturally.</p>
