    title: "Nap and Schedule Optimizer for 12-36 Months",

    title: "Bedtime Routines and Emotional Coaching",
    content: "The last ten minutes of the day shape how your child feels about sleep. Children don't fall asleep because they're told to. They fall asleep because they feel safe enough to let go. Your tone, phrasing, and boundaries form the emotional bridge between wakefulness and rest.",

    content: "Week 2 is where structure meets independence. You'll begin gradually reducing your physical involvement while maintaining emotional presence. This week isn't about 'doing less.' It's about trusting the groundwork you've already laid.",
